# Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning using BERT

The hands on project on Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning using BERT is divided into following tasks:

Task 1: An introduction to some basic theory behind BERT, and the problem we will be using it to solve

Task 2: Explore dataset distribution and some basic preprocessing

Task 3: Split dataset into training and validation using stratified approach

Task 4: Loading pretrained tokenizer to encode our text data into numerical values (tensors)

Task 5: Load in pretrained BERT with custom final layer

Task 6: Create dataloaders to facilitate batch processing

Task 7: Choose and optimizer and scheduler to control training of model

Task 8: Design performance metrics for our problem

Task 9: Create a training loop to control PyTorch finetuning of BERT using CPU or GPU acceleration

Task 10: Load in a pre-saved finetuned BERT model and evaluate its performance, and some final thoughts



The course materials belong entirely to coursera. The answers are the only things that show my trials.
